# 📌 Project Overview


This project demonstrates my ability to use SQL for data analysis. Using a retail sales dataset, I built a relational database, wrote SQL queries, and generated insights that could help a business understand its sales performance, customers, and products.

The goal is to showcase core data analyst skills: data modeling, query writing, and extracting actionable insights.
